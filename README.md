There are files
1. bison8_fractional.py
2. bison_battle.py

1.Use this to play against mcts,nice pygame interface,default 
iterations are set to 800,
i.e. computer "thinks" 800 times.

2.Designed to watch mcts vs alpha-beta battle, there are adjustable
parameters
ab - depth and mcts - iterations.
Current depth 8 and iterations 2000,these numbers are too big in my 
humble opinion.
